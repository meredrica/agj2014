3. About the game
—————————————————


In this game you are surrounded by people, all of very different nations.
Everyone of them could want your job, your wife or even your very own life.
So this game is about survival, about killing or getting killed.
But who is innocent and who wants your head?
Start the game in local coop, find yourself in the mob, track down the enemy players and kill them before they kill you.
